# CÃ¶derBoosters
Spring Boot web application that connects everyday gamers with professionals through a platform,
where users can either ask for in-game help or provide their services to those in need.
The platform manages transactions between users via an e-coin.

## Features
- Account Login / Registration (either as Customer or Booster)
- Creating Order: gamers might need help to achieve in-game goals, these orders are advertisements
- Orders Page: filterable customer/booster related orders page

- E-coin System / Transactions: as a customer transfer funds from PayPal (dummy implementation) to your CB account,
and as a booster, earn coins and get paid by CB.
